    "insights": [
      "Do you think at scale companies, I don't know, maybe after hundreds of people, they should have a team, like an onboarding optimization team?",
      "I don't actually recommend hiring that as your first hire, but when you are onto something and you really need expertise and you don't have that expertise internally, yes, I think hiring externally is the right thing to do at that point because those are really specific skills that some people have taken years to learn.",
      "And so you should expect to improve your overall cohort retention curves by focusing on the onboarding and activation experience.",
      "That is an example of how you go from, we've learned some things by humans that have made a 25% impact to now we're building these into the product.",
      "Adam Fishman: So as we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, or the right way to talk about your Patreon page or the right way to message it in the beginning, we would go back and say, \"How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?\" But if we weren't gaining new insights, we weren't just tweaking the onboarding experience and trying to tune it in a very micro way, because the reality is, that doesn't really move the needle that often, especially once you've got it in a pretty good foundational place."

      "And once you hear why, this will make a lot of sense.: Also, they keep long-term holdouts for every experiment they run, and they automatically look at the impact these experiments have had on the business a year later, two years later, and three years later, and then revisit these decisions down the road.: And in our conversation, we dig into all of this plus how Shopify organizes their growth team, how they run experiments, how the growth team collaborates with the product team, how they measure impact.",
      "Lenny Rachitsky: Yes, and nobody wants to hear this, except people that you should want to hear this because if you want to build a business that grows and need to grow, it's better to know to learn that now.",
      "Well what are you going to do that for people to grow up on Shopify and to be the biggest companies, but we're also going to take folks another platform, bring them over.: For growth in sales, I think the biggest learning from the the R&D side at least has been the scale is very different with sales, and so it's really hard to use as much quantitative data to make growth, to make some of those decisions.: And so a lot of it has been building much more qualitative insights working with merchant success, sales about the challenges they're facing and onboarding a large customer.",
      "I think you're tearing the heart out of so many growth people right now, and nobody wants to hear this that works on growth where you're saying potentially a third of the experiments they're running today that are showing lift probably don't have that same...",
      "It was like you can go anywhere in the product, but let's go figure out how to work together to figure out that quality bar to understand when you're going to be different on it, on the quality bar to get something out to learn, and just building trust along the way that we're actually going to ship high quality things and we ship it to 100% and move."

    "insights": [
      "There's no one other than your manager who can really help to increase your scope or to help make sure that the team has the right pieces in place, or dial in some of the issues that you might see in culture.: And so that is why people say they don't leave a job, they leave a manager because the manager is the one that has a lot of the power to fix a lot of these variables.",
      "And then the last thing I actually talk about is, when it comes to execution, I think people don't, especially product managers, don't do enough of watching and learning from others.",
      "Lenny Rachitsky: This is so interesting, because everyone imagines Instagram, virality, word of mouth, like SEO and partnerships sounds like a core part of Instagram's early growth, which I don't think anyone ever talks about.",
      "And they don't really take the time to actually learn who the people are, what the story is, what they care about, what they're passionate about, both professionally and personally and really try to understand how the team is working from that person's perspective.: And what I find is actually when I do that, people are way more willing to hear ...",
      "And it helped really me to see that the world can be very similar in so many ways and it is very much reflected to me in my day-to-day life in tech because as you know in the Bay Area, there's so many people who come from so many walks of life who end up in this journey building these products and companies and just help me to value so many different voices.: If you want to build world-class products, if you want to build product that can scale around the world, if you want to build product that's be hypergrowth, you have to be inclusive of so many voices."

    "title": "Why most product managers are unprepared for the demands of a real startup | Casey Winters",
    "insights": [
      "For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run.",
      "It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.: As long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results.",
      "And this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually.",
      "It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.: You're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops.",
      "But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.: Those people are going to have ideas all the time."

    "guest": "Christopher Miller",
    "title": "Relentless curiosity, radical accountability, and HubSpot’s winning growth formula | Chris Miller",
    "insights": [
      "Chris Miller: Yeah, one of the traits that I look for in PMs that I hire onto my teams, and also when I think back to the people that I've learned a lot from working with over the years, one of the common behaviors or traits is relentless curiosity, this insatiable desire to understand things and a lack of fear in admitting when they don't understand things and being uncompromising and getting the answers so that they do understand.",
      "I would also say that if you're already at a shop where you are working at a different function and you're sort of product curious, go talk to the PMs, literally I say go reach out to a PM and ask how you can make their day easier.: Figure out what you can do in your spare time that they can offload to you and do a little bit of volunteer labor, even if that's just shadowing because I think just getting that context and understanding the sort of rhythm of how a team ideates and defines problems and prioritizes and ship software is the experience that's going to be the most important because a lot of product management is also managing personalities and figuring out how people want to work with you and figuring out how you work for them.",
      "And so, that's why that sort of proximity to the customer and directing that sort of relentless curiosity towards the qualitative stuff is so, so important because you just learn things that are just sometimes really unintuitive or are blind spots because we're often not the people we're building product for.",
      "We really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach, and what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, so we approached the team who owned it and we were like, \"Are you all working on this?\" They were like, \"Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff.\" We were like, \"Can we take this?\" They were like, \"Sure, if you want it.\" And so, we took it and immediately blew it up, and so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it.",
      "Seven years later, he leads both their growth and AI teams and advises founders on product-like growth and growth strategy in general.: In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover what it takes to become a successful product leader in tech, what skills the most successful PMs need to build, how to find mentors, why you need to scrape your knees as an early PM."

      "In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.: Deb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people.",
      "I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, \"Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months.",
      "Lenny Rachitsky: It's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff.",
      "I tell people sometimes we overthink as product manager if we just had the perfect plan, the perfect battle plan, but instead imagine you're a team and you can ship, I don't know, let's say four things.",

    "insights": [
      "What works now, what no longer works, and what has surprised her most about how Lovable grows.: She also shares her advice about whether working at an AI company is right for you, some incredibly interesting insights into Lovable's secret sauce for growth, the unique ways they operate internally, their approach to building minimal, Lovable products, also how they hire, and also how product market fit as a concept is no longer what it used to be, and how every company basically has to recapture product market fit every three months.",
      "For paid retention, I know there is so much on the market of, oh, this is a high product, and it's a leaky bucket, and it has really high churn rates.: Although, I shouldn't share, it's not public numbers for us to share actual retention, however, what I can say, it's on par with benchmarks of other B2B SaaS products that I've ever worked at.",
      "Lenny Rachitsky: Okay, that is also a very big deal, every growth person that's ever been on this podcast, including you, always talks about the power of activation, just how much opportunity there is to get people to this aha moment, realize the value of this product, that increases retention and increases everything.",
      "We don't have really large sales team, we have only a couple sales folks, and they're just starting to ramp up their enterprise efforts so we don't have really big enterprise demand gen costs as well.: From that perspective, if you look at the equation and you say, \"Well, okay, if you're not going to do a lot of paid marketing, if you're not going to do a lot of sales, because we're really only working on hand raisers of people that are saying right now that they want to buy Lovable, then whereas you don't have big costs, so you can spend it on product.\": That is the beautiful part because when we are giving our product away to our customers, we're not competing with other companies in that space, because they're just going to use Lovable in their hackathon.",
      "Elena Verna: I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, everybody and their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them."

      "Something that I should mention as we talk through this is we're talking about all these ways to grow the product, but at the core is a great product that people actually find valuable and want to keep using.",
      "And I was like, \"Oh no, the engineers and the product team are, if they say a product can do something, it can do that and more.\" Meltem Kuran Berkowitz: So early days of my team pitching Deel was people were like, \"I don't think you guys can do all of that.",
      "And my first question is, early on when you were building the team, the growth team specifically, at Deel, what skills did you find were most important to look for?",
      "And some people are like, \"I would build a team for that.\" And of course in the future, maybe you should, but that shouldn't be your first answer.",
      "Meltem Kuran Berkowitz: And a really good way to also test for that is, this is more on the case study process, but asking someone to come up with a strategy with $0, with $10,000 and maybe a hundred thousand dollars to see if they're going to be able to scale with you."

      "Is there anything else that either tactically you find as a really important component of this relationship or any other lessons you've learned about just how to keep this relationship healthy and constructive?",
      "The point you made about how things are going to keep changing as you grow is such an important point that I don't feel like comes up as much as I thought would come up on this podcast.",

      "I know you weren't there at the beginning of Ramp's journey, but from what you know, what do you think the team did early on to seed this level of growth and success other than just building an awesome product that people really love?",
      "They're not owning product metrics or what have you, they're obviously of course interim and input metrics that are important, but they really do feel accountable for the pipeline driven and the efficiency driven by that team.",
      "And another way to put it is just a repeatable scalable growth process, whether it's at Ramp or Opendoor, Instacart, Sri Batchu: People talk a lot about what should the right design of the team be or profiles of people on the team, et cetera.",
      "And you've created a culture of defining hypotheses that are data driven and a culture where that can be executed quickly and have an MVP mentality for product and non-product projects where people can fail and learn quickly and iterate quickly.",
      "So I think that part of it is more important than the specific people or their functions in many ways to me, especially when you're starting to build a growth engine."

      "And how should people think about paid in the consumer subscription startup?",
      "And the only way to determine causality is through real controlled experiments, randomized control experiments through incrementality testing, which is typically really hard to do cleanly and also companies have always been often wary about doing it because you have to turn off a channel potentially in a key demo and you're like, \"Yeah.\" The benefit is to learning of whether it's actually incremental, but the cost or the sales that I will lose today.",
      "In our chat, we get incredibly tactical about all of the ways that you can grow your product, including when and how to invest in virality, SEO, and paid growth.",
      "Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.",
      "So if you have network effects, AKA if the product becomes more useful with more people or there's amazing word of mouth already, or there's collaboration, probably a good sign that you could lean into virality or maybe referrals."

    "guest": "Austin Hay",
    "title": "The ultimate guide to Martech | Austin Hay (Reforge, Ramp, Runway)",
    "insights": [
      "And I think really the way to think about marketing technology is it's a product manager whose specific role and focus is the system or the third party or first party platform because marketing technology can mean a collection of third party tools, which is a lot of people think, but as a company scales and grows actually it could include a collection of first party homegrown solutions that you build yourself with or in addition to third party.",
      "In our conversation, Austin explains what exactly is MarTech, how it fits into your growth organization when you need to hire a MarTech person and what to look for plus his favorite interview questions.: Also, his favorite tools, frameworks, team structures, and emerging platforms that he's most excited about.",
      "Maybe a sign that you should start thinking about a MarTech person on a growth team is what I'm hearing is you're starting to accumulate all these different tools and maybe there's a sense that you could be a lot more efficient in connecting data and the backend infrastructure for how you think about growth and how you drive growth and measure growth.",
      "And then usually the teams are small and super cross-functional.: So, what I would say is more important to look for than how many people has this person managed is how well can they manage upward, laterally and downward because they're going to have to go talk to the head of rev ops if they want to change something in Salesforce, they're going to have to talk to the VP of product if they want to make a big platform change that touches something else.",
      "In the same way that a business might launch an external product goal to launch a feature, they sometimes also might have internal product goals, clean up our revenue operations systems, make our email marketing system better."

    "title": "Why ChatGPT will be the next big growth channel (and how to capitalize on it) | Brian Balfour",
    "insights": [
      "I imagine it's also important to note, this is a natural thing that would happen if you build the thing and it grows and you're like, \"Oh, maybe we should change strategy.\" I imagine not everyone even knows this is what will happen and they organically evolve their strategy, or do you think everyone's just like, \"This is now going to be our plan, Step 1, 2, 3, 4?\" Brian Balfour: I think a different version of that question is I think some people could sit here and interpret this as all these folks are evil.",
      "Essentially, you've uncovered a really important trend or insight about how products are going to grow differently in the future, how growth is changing, and this is something that I think a lot of people need to hear, so I asked you to come on to share what you're seeing.",
      "TThey can get so big and they can give access, so much access of distribution to new developers, they don't want to enable their own disruption as well as they need to keep growing.: My guess is anybody who is sitting in their shoes owning their platform is going to follow the exact same playbook and the exact same reasoning.",
      "Just to be crystal clear about what listeners should do, what founders should do, what product teams should do, the advice here essentially is integrate with ChatGPT, maybe Gemini, maybe if Apple has something, actually integrate with what they launch.",
      "So we started to take a really big bet on that and started to develop this new platform for AI-native product teams.: The first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today and auto-generate the research to go gather all those new insights, so complete the full cycle."

      "So when people do come to us with an amazing product idea or a feature that they want to build or an entire team that they think should be spun up, we really listen to them, and if it makes sense, we say, \"Go and do that.",
      "We've redesigned Canva for this collaborative enterprise age, so we'll be pulling the covers off that alongside work kits, which are a whole verticalized experiences for people inside marketing and sales and HR that want to use Canva, as well as a bunch of improvements to our AI products and an actual enterprise skew that we're launching as well.: So through this growth and through getting to understand the needs of CIOs and heads of security at enterprises, we've realized that there pretty much needs to be a new enterprise product of Canva that meets the needs of hugely scaled teams, which has been quite different for us because we have scaled from those individuals just using the product all by themselves and organically growing the teams.",
      "That was the whole genesis of Canva itself, having a product that we thought people would love to use and desperately needed to get out into the world and that's the lens that we approach everything through.: In terms of board meetings, I think it's been very helpful that our financials and our growth have been amazing for so many years that we don't need to focus on it and we can just have that one slide with the graph going up and to the right.",
      "That's one aspect of why some people I think don't land on their feet at Canva because they aren't necessarily visual thinkers and they don't end up communicating what they want to do in a visual way to the rest of people at Canva.: Another way is that the way that we've grown, the way that we've built product has been quite idiosyncratic over the years."
